# Machine Learning: Regression on California Housing dataset

## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of the California Housing Prices dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). The project demonstrates various techniques in data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning.

## Dataset
The California Housing Prices dataset contains data from the 1990 California census. It includes metrics such as population, median income, median housing price, and more for each block group in California. This dataset is ideal for practicing machine learning and pattern recognition techniques.

## How to Use
Start from creating a dedicated environment for the project. If using conda, use
```
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.10
conda activate your_env_name
```
When creating your environment, make sure to select your own name. Then, install dependencies using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
